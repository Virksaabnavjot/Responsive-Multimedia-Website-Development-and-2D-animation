Hey Leonie, 
I was working on Citrix on animation in adobe proffesional this morning and it suddenly stopped
and now the .fla file is not opening.  So, i have informed IT about this problem and
they are saying that they might RECOVER the file from college backup but that might take some days. 
So, for 
now i have used a decompiler to decompile my SWF file to get the source code of fla file. So you 
can look at the THIS FOLDER TO SEE THE SOURCE CODE OF MY FLA --- Table.swf.xfl

PROBLEM IS NOW SOLVED WE HAVE UPLOADED THE PROJECT AGAIN THANKS.
