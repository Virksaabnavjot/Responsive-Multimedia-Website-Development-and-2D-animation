# Responsive-Multimedia-Website-Development-and-2D-animation

Second Year college project, with an aim to develop a fully responsive web application and 2D animation from scratch.
The project was challeging and required a learning curve in order to sucessfully complete the project.

We learned using Adobe Fireworks in order to create interactive 2D animation for the web application.
And for the web app - we used strict HTML, Javascript and CSS3 principles to achieve a responsive application across all platforms - desktop/mobile/ipads and used Github for version control.
